Team Contract
Team members present: Kevin, Zach, Colin

Goals:
Our group intends to win the final competition. Personally, we would like to improve our grades in 6.005 while deepening our understanding of Java. Specifically, we would like to gain a firmer grasp of the MVC idiom, GUI's, and networking. All team members are committed to doing the best work possible, and if someone is having trouble doing the necessary work, he will communicate these troubles as early as possible so that the situation can be resolved. 

Meeting Norms:
We will hold regular, informal meetings (approximately once every three days for the early portion of the project); each meeting should last approximately an hour (with contingencies when the team is near deadlines). We will use Google Docs and e-mails to record and communicate meeting minutes.

Work Norms:
The work will be distributed by consensus in accordance with the preferences of team members; each of us is willing to defer to specific requests of team members to tackle particular portions of the project. We will set deadlines at each meeting; each individual assignment will be completed and reviewed by the assigned team member three days in advance of the class deadlines to allow for peer review. Any differences of opinion the quality of the work can be talked out among the team members.

Decision Making:
All decisions will be made by consensus, and individual fixation on an idea will be addressed through discussion among all team members.
